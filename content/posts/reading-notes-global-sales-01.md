## Basic Concepts

- Differences between international & domestic sales 
  - existing relationship of trust (must be established)
  - demands and workflow of customers
  - the process of internal information

- the more skilled, motivated and trained people that are selling your product, the more you will sell.

### Forece Multiplication
- Global distribution agreement
- Distributors
- Manufacturer's representatives
- Consultants

Your success is directly tied to distributor mind share

### corruption and illegal activities
check the legal issues of every aspect of international trade carefully.
- Do not treat this as a joke or something to try to get around
- Don't try to cheat, bribe or ship product to places that your government doesn't want you to.

### Product Changes 
- changes will be much larger in scope, much more expensive and much slower than you foresee

- Distributors are concerned about their future and consernded that a manufacturer are thinking about future products. But if they don't believe they can sell the products i have today, don't want to work with them.

- Localization: Things can be believed in is products that are designed for multiple international market
  - example: software that works in different languages

- Language is probably the **most relecant** change in a product.

- second: addressing a funamental difference in electricity or plumbing or installation in different markets
  - make it easier for customers to by and incrementally increase sales.
  - Putting in electrical current adapters in today's world is pretty much a no-brainer

- Don't confuse a sales problem with an engineering problem - it is very seldom profitable to change products to fit each market

- In many fields, especially healthcare, communications transportation, and security, there are market requirements that are not specified by law
  - need to clarify whether a requirement is a leagal requirement or just that the market is used to: convention / tradition.
    - can be deal with by getting reference with very unhappy key opinion leaders who also don't like the local manufacturers.
  - but legal requirements must be obeyed (CE Certification in Europe Market)

- Don't let your contributors or end users know the timetable or pruduct feature package for changes or new product.
  - distributors will stop selling your present products and wait.
  - end users don't want to buy a product that they thought would be obsolete in a year or so.

- people are making product change requests all the time
  - document them in case they can be utilized in the development of the future product.

- all contact with end users, customers, and potential end users, should be discussed clearly with the head of international sales 
  - especially when it has to do with potential changes to the product,
  - to make sure that the messaging and communications are aligned.
