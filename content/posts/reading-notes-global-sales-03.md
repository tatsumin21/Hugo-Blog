## Building a Sales Organization

### Sales Process

Sales Process - an important element of the work we are operating - is like a pyramid.

It should be effective, robust, scalable, and reproductible.


Everypart of the sales process should be related to

- Finding customers
- Establishing rapport/trust with customers
- Helping the customer internalize that you can solve their problem
- Delivering the goods and collecting payment

Two core elements:

- Establishing trust with cusotmers

    Establishing a relationship with your international customers can be very challenging. every foreign business culture requires more than overwhelm an domestic market to build trust. Therefore having a distributor who owns this part of the sales process is usually key.

- Helping the customer internalize that your products can solve their problem

    Not everyone internalizes data the same way, culturally. Several of the main cultural indicators create difficulty or barriers to quickly establishing trust.

    We can talk to the customer about their problems and feed them information from  seemingly neutral third-party key opinion leaders or our existing customers about how thez have solved these problems.

    - present to deifferent departments, utilizing slides/videos
    - work with technical people within the customer organization

If you don't know how something relates to those parts, don't do it until you can figure that out.

You should know who is responsible for every part of the sles process and how you can hold them accountable.

### Build a More Reasonable Sales Process

#### Finding customers: 

Most of tge work will probably fall on the distributor.
Besides, we can also:

- reach out the manufacturer based on the manufacturer's marketing conferences, websites, etc
- customers who will buy off advice from consulting companies and advisory companies
- in different territories looking for signs of renovation or new build, utilizing people who are in contact today with the target group.

#### Payment and installation: 

We can bring various credit insurance organization into this process to guarantee that the manufacturer will receive payment.

The easiest and cheapest thing to solve difficulty in installation and servicing that the company can add to its human resources is a service team, which means you can always find technicans that will be cheaper to hire and train than salespeople.

#### After-Sale

After-sales service is verz important and typically falls on the distributors.
- The distributor hires technical support people with qualifications specified by the manufcaturer to be able to carry out technical support.
