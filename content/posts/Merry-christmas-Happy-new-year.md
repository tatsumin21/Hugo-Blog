It's 2 mounths since i was starting to work. Everything is going on smoothly.

It's difficult to say:"It's so easy!". 

Actually, nothing is easy when you start to do a brand new thihng, especially this is my first work in my whole life. 

However, at least until now, I can say that i think i can make it.

Even though the salary is not so high, this work make it possible for me to stay at Germany and actually become a independet adult.

In this side, I always want to thank my company and especially my team leader.

The whole year of 2021 was tough due to the CoVid-19. It is still going on and it seems like it never ends.
But at least the Christmas was quite and peaceful, and hope the Silver's day and the coming new year of 2022 will also be like that.

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!
